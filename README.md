## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to my personal growth in JavaScript. Here, I am recording code samples, projects, and key concepts that I learn along the way. The goal is to create a well-organized and easy-to-reference resource as I deepen my knowledge of JavaScript. Each file is commented in both English and Spanish for clarity and documentation.

## Contents
This repository covers the following JavaScript concepts:
- Variables and Data Types
- Functions and Scope
- Control Structures (if, for, while)
- Objects and Arrays
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling
- Promises and Async/Await
- ES6 and Newer Features
- Data Structures (Hash Tables, Sets, Maps)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Error Handling

More topics will be added as I progress in my learning.
